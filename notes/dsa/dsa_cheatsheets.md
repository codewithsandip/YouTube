# Data Structures and Algorithms

# Big O
- Computer programs are collection of data and functions
- Multiple implementations of a single problem exist, multiple developers coming up with different solution, who is best. Example of string reverse on stack overflow
- Idea of good code vs bad code
- Most important is scalable code
- Why it matters as my solution works - your solution might work for handful of data but what about millions of data. Examples - amazon products, twitter tweets, Instagram feeds etc. Itâ€™s important in terms of interviews.
- Ways of justifying a code - Excellent, Good, Fair, Bad, Horrible
- Practical example: Write a function that calculates sum of all the numbers starting from 1 upto N.
- How can we say which solution is better? - Readable, fast, memory efficient.
- Lets say performance matters a lot - use performance.now() js function, results are machine specific, hence we can take them as judgement calls only

# Big O Expressions
- We can come up with a big o expression of solution by counting number of operations
- Big O can 5n + 2 but we look for general trends - O(n)
- Bio O allows us to identify the runtime of an algorithm as input grows it impacts the runtime of an algo as well
- Three major Big O expressions:
- f(n) = n linear, O(n)
- f(n) = n^2 quadratic, O(n^2)
- f(n) = 1 constant, O(1)
