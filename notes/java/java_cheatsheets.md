# Java

## Getting Started
- We write java code inside classes.
- Your program should have atleast one java class.
- main() method is an entry point for the application.
- To compile Java code: javac file-name.java
- To run Java code: java file-name
- Classname must have camelcase naming.

## Variables
- Java has 6 main datatypes
- int: whole numbers (upto 2B)
- long: large whole numbers (upto 9 quintillion)
- double: decimal numbers
- String: text
- char: a single character
- boolean: true or false value

## Math Operators
- +: addition
- -: subtraction
- *: multiplication
- /: division
- %: modulus, returns the remainder of division operation
- ++: add one
- --: subtract one
- +=: add by value on rhs
- -=: subtract by value on rhs

## Scanner
- Scanner is used to collect values from users
- We can ask questions to users and based on there answers we can collect those values of different data types
- **nextLine** method is used to wait for a string input from user
- **nextDouble** is used to wait for double value 
- **nextInt** is used to wait for integer value
- Exception is throws when user enters a wrong value type
- Scanner has to be closed using **close** method else it will cause a memory leak
- Use **\n** to add a new line

## Booleans
- Boolean is a datatype like int, long, double, char, strings we have used previously
- Booleans can store true or false value
- Booleans help us in comparison & making decisions based on those comparisons
- We can use to form expressions which will be evaluated to a value of true or false

## Comparisons
- ">" : greater than
- < : less than
- ">=" : greater than or equal to
- <= : less than or equal to
- == : equal to
- != : not equal to
- equals : equal to for strings
- !equals : not equal to for strings
