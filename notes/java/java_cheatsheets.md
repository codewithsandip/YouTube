# Java

## Getting Started
- We write java code inside classes.
- Your program should have atleast one java class.
- main() method is an entry point for the application.
- To compile Java code: javac file-name.java
- To run Java code: java file-name
- Classname must have camelcase naming.

## Variables
- Java has 6 main datatypes
- int: whole numbers (upto 2B)
- long: large whole numbers (upto 9 quintillion)
- double: decimal numbers
- String: text
- char: a single character
- boolean: true or false value

## Math Operators
- +: addition
- -: subtraction
- *: multiplication
- /: division
- %: modulus, returns the remainder of division operation
- ++: add one
- --: subtract one
- +=: add by value on rhs
- -=: subtract by value on rhs

## Scanner
- Scanner is used to collect values from users
- We can ask questions to users and based on there answers we can collect those values of different data types
- **nextLine** method is used to wait for a string input from user
- **nextDouble** is used to wait for double value 
- **nextInt** is used to wait for integer value
- Exception is throws when user enters a wrong value type
- Scanner has to be closed using **close** method else it will cause a memory leak
- Use **\n** to add a new line
